#Applicable to FM demodulator only

#deemph-tc = 530.5   # microseconds; 300 Hz corner frequency

#Applicable to WFM demodulator only
#channels = 2 (forced)
# downconverter samprate forced to 384k, output forced to 48k stereo
#gain = 1.0          # depends on bandwidth and sample rate
#deemph-tc = 75.0    # microseconds; change to 50.0 outside North America & Korea
#deemph-gain = 0.0   # dB, not necessary for WFM because of high corner frequency
